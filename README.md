# ReactJS-Animations

 React provides a ReactTransitionGroup add-on component as a low-level API for animation, and a ReactCSSTransitionGroup for easily implementing basic CSS animations and transitions.
 
# Step 1 - Install React CSS Transitions Group

 This is React add-on used for creating basic CSS transitions and animations. We will install it from command prompt window 
 
        C:\Users\username\Desktop\reactApp>npm install react-addons-css-transition-group

# Step 2 - Add CSS file

 Let's create new folder css and file style.css inside. To be able to use it in our app, we need to link it to the head element in index.html.
 
        <link rel = "stylesheet" type = "text/css" href = "css/style.css">
